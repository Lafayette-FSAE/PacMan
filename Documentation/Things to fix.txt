To do:

Confirm with Connor what the 6 pins are
Time delay for safety loop in the event of a firmware crash - could probably be RC circuit at gate of FET driver
QRCode to GitHub project
Include RTC battery in BOM
Include straight headers for Micro on BOM



Complete:

Extend the solder pads for the fuse holder footprint to help with soldering
Add measurement for SLOOP points to the microcontroller
Confirm CAN GPIO pins on micro
Redo all micro pins
Increase size of title and name text
Redo mounting holes to use Imperial system
Add "Made in USA" text
Try to leave room for USB between micro and panel header
Make entire board smaller, width and length
