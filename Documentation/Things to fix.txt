To do:

Verify resistor and capacitor values in schematic with what is on board
ESP32 footprint outer size
Spec new capacitors for back of board and fix the footprints
Increase capacitor sizing for bulk caps on power supplies
Confirm with Connor what the 6 pins are
Time delay for safety loop in the event of a firmware crash - could probably be RC circuit at gate of FET driver
QRCode to GitHub project
Include a mounting hole for RTC and mounting hardware
Include RTC battery in BOM
Include right angle headers for RTC and straight headers for Micro on BOM



Complete:

Extend the solder pads for the fuse holder footprint to help with soldering
Add measurement for SLOOP points to the microcontroller
Confirm CAN GPIO pins on micro
Redo all micro pins
Increase size of title and name text
Redo mounting holes to use Imperial system
Add "Made in USA" text
Try to leave room for USB between micro and panel header
Make entire board smaller, width and length
Consider adding test points for SDA/SCL
