To do:

Confirm CAN GPIO pins on micro
ESP32 footprint outer size
Spec new capacitors for back of board and fix the footprints
Include right angle headers for RTC and straight headers for Micro on BOM
Verify resistor and capacitor values in schematic with what is on board
Increase size of title and name text
Try to leave room for USB between micro and panel header
Redo all micro pins
Redo mounting holes to use Imperial system
Make entire board smaller, width and length
Confirm with Connor what the 6 pins are
Time delay for safety loop in the event of a firmware crash - could probably be RC circuit at gate of FET driver
Consider adding test points for SDA/SCL
Add "Made in USA" text
QRCode to GitHub project
Include a mounting hole for RTC and mounting hardware
Include RTC battery in BOM
Increase capacitor sizing for bulk caps on power supplies


Complete:

Extend the solder pads for the fuse holder footprint to help with soldering
Add measurement for SLOOP points to the microcontroller
